# Setup

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, max.print=100)  # this setting affects the printing of tables
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

- Install the package `nycflights13`. 
- The package contains five datasets: `airlines`, `airports`, `planes`, `weather`, `flights`. 
- We can access descriptive information of the data and variables via `help(airlines)`, `help(airports)`, etc. 
- When the `nyflights13` package is loaded, we can access the datasets by their names. To make them visible in the global environment we assign them to some name.

```{r}
# This looks weired, but it makes the data visible in the global environment 
airlines <- airlines   
airports <- airports
planes <- planes
weather <- nycflights13::weather # This statement is maybe less confusing
flights <- nycflights13::flights # This statement is maybe less confusing
```

# Analyse data
## Airlines
Inspect the airlines data via `View` and print the first 5 rows.

> Note: It is helpful to `View` the data in interactive analysis, but afterwards delete it from your script or Rmd file.

```{r}
View(airlines)

airlines %>%
  top_n(n=5)

```

## Airports 
Inspect the airports data via `View`. It contains the column `alt` which is the altitude of the airport in feet. Replace `alt` by the corresponding altitude in meters (meter = feet * 3.28084). Use the `mutate` function for this operation. You have to assign again to `airports` in order to change the data (not only print the changes).
```{r}
view(airports)
airports <- airports %>% mutate(alt = alt*3.28084)
```

Filter for the 5 airports with the highest altitude
```{r}
airports %>% 
  select(name,alt) %>%
  arrange(desc(alt)) %>%
  top_n(n=5)
  

```

Filter for all airports which are located at an altitude lower than sea level
```{r}
airports %>%
  select(name, alt) %>%
  filter(alt < 0)
```

## Weather
Use `View` to inspect the data and print the first 5 rows. Does the data only cover the airports in New York, or also the weather data at destination airports? 
It covers other destinations as well.
```{r}
View(weather)
weather %>%
  top_n(n=5)

```


Let's change the units of the weather data to European standards.  

- Temperature (`temp`) and dew point (`dewp`): Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9 
- Visibility (`visib`): kilometer = miles / 1.60934
- Wind speed (`wind_speed`): kilometer/hour = (miles/hour) /1.60934
- Precipitation (`precip`): millimeter = inches * 20.54

>Again, use the `mutate` function and assign the result back to `weather` in order to save the changes to the data.

```{r}
weather <- weather %>%
  mutate(temp = (temp-32)* 5 / 9)
weather <- weather %>%
  mutate(dewp = (dewp - 32) * 5 / 9)

weather <- weather %>%
  mutate(visib = visib / 1.60934) %>%
  mutate(wind_speed = wind_speed / 1.60934) %>%
  mutate(precip = precip * 20.54)
weather

```

After such a transforation we should check whether values are plausbile:

> Use dplyr functions such as `filter`, `summarise`, and `group_by`. And note that there are some missing values (`NAs`) in the data. If a summary function like `mean` or `min` returns missing values, you may want to use the option `na.rm = TRUE`.

What was the 2013 average of `temp`, `wind_speed`, and `visib` at the JFK airport?
```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(year == 2013) %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise( avrgtemp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), avrwindspeed = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), avrvisib = mean(visib, na.rm = TRUE))
 

```

What was the *monthly* average of `temp`, `wind_speed`, and `visib` at the JFK airport?
```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(year == 2013, origin == 'JFK') %>%
  group_by(origin, month) %>%
  summarise( avrgtemp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), avrwindspeed = mean(wind_speed, na.rm = TRUE), avrvisib = mean(visib, na.rm = TRUE))

```

What was the minimum `temp`, the maximum `temp`, and the total amount of `precip` at each of the 3 airports in December 2013? 

```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(year == 2013, month == 12) %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarise(maxtemp = max(temp), mintemp = min(temp), sumprecip = sum(precip))


```


## Planes
Look at the data via `View` and print the first 5 rows.
```{r}
view(planes)
planes %>%
  top_n(n=5)
```

Count the numer of planes per `manufacturer` and sort in descending order? 

> You can either count via `summarise(n())`, or more easily via `count()`.

```{r}
planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(anzahl= n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(anzahl))

planes %>% 
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Count the number of planes per `manufacturer` and `model` and again sort in descending order
```{r}
planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise( anzahl1 = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(anzahl1))

planes %>%
  select(manufacturer,model) %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise( anzahl2 = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(anzahl2))


```

Calculate per manufacturer: 1. number of planes, 2. average number of `seats`, 3. average number of `engines`, 4. average `year` when the planes where manufactured. And again order in descending order of the number of planes

```{r}
planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(anzahlplanes = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(anzahlplanes))

  planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(anzahlplanes = n(),avgrseats = mean(seats), avgengines = mean(engines), avgyear = mean(year, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(anzahlplanes))

planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(avgengines = mean(engines)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avgengines))

planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(avgyear = mean(year)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avgyear))

```


## Flights
Inspect the flights data with `View` and print the first 5 rows.
```{r}
```

Let's analyse how take-off times at NYC airports vary in the course of the day. Count the total number of flights (of the whole year) per `hour` of departure.
```{r}
```

Count the number of flights by destionation airport (`dest`) and arrange them in descending order.
```{r}

```

# Join datasets
It is more convenient to have the full names of the destination airports rather than airport codes. So let's join flights data and airport data. We have to address two issues: 

1. **Join variable**: The variable through which the join is supposed to happen has different names in the two datasets. It is called `dest` in the flights data, and `faa` in the airports data. Renaming the variables in the orignal data sets is not a good option because this would make the variable names less informative. Use `help(join)` to find out how we can carry out this join.

2. **Which type of join is useful here?** Inner, left, right, full join, ...? It depends on the question that we want to address. 

In general, an **inner join** is the strictest join type. If the codes in the airport and flights data don't match, we will end up with no data at all. However, if they match perfectly, this would be an efficient and clean solution. We should prefer an inner join if possible. An **outer join** is the most conservative join type. We don't run the risk of losing any information. But the joined data might contain a lot of missing values with respect to flight and airport data. A **left join** (and by analogy the **right join**) lies somewhere in between. It preserves all data available of the first data (let's say `flights`), but may lose information of the second data (`airports`) if there were no flights to some of the airports in 2013. 

## Inner join

A suggestion is to start with an inner join. Then we evaluate whether we lost important information through this inner join. If no, then we are just fine. If yes, we can consider a left join that preserves all flights and adds the available airport metadata. The occasions / questions where we need a full join are relatively rare.

```{r}
# df_inner <- flights %>% inner_join(airports, by = ...)
```

## Left join
Did we lose information on flights. If yes, replace the inner join by a left join (where x = `flights` and y = `airports`). 

```{r}

```

## Right join
**What about a right join** (where x = `flights` and y = `airports`)? 

Do a right join and look at the data afterwards. How many rows does the data have? Are there missing values? How do you judge this join type? How useful is it in our context?

```{r}

```

A general thought on the decision between left and right join: In datawarehouse terms, the 5 datasets form a **star schema** (see picture below) with 1 **fact table** `flights` in the center and multiple **dimension tables** (`airports`, `weather`, ...) at the margin. The fact table contains numeric values on flight events, and it contains foreign keys that connect with the dimension tables. Generally, fact tables are more interesting from an analytical perspective. Thus, we would usually chose the join type which preserves the full fact table `flights` at the cost of potentially not having all airport metadata, rather than the other way round. In short: we should stick with the left join.

**Is it worth all that joining?** Let's rerun our pevious analysis using the joined data - the one that you prefer. Count the number of flights by destionation airport (`dest`) and the corresponding `name` and arrange them in descending order.
```{r}

```

# More questions
As we see in the figure above, we can join the data in many more ways. Practice joining! Start by asking yourself a question that relates to 2 (or more) of the datasets, and then try to answer it.

Some questions for inspiration:

- **Planes**: Do smaller planes (measured by the number of seats) have less departure delay?
- **Airlines I**: 
  - **Flight distance**: Calculate the average flight distance by airline and display the top 10 airlines
  - **Delay**: What's the average delay by airline? (But note that this will be strongly correlated with flight distance, so you may want to account for that)
- **Weather**: How is bad weather (precipitation, low visibility, extremely low temperatures) at NYC related to departure delay? Here you need to join via 5 variables!
- **Airports**: Visualize some routs via the longitude (`lon`) and latitude (`lat`) data in the `airports` data, and color the lines depending on the average delay. **Careful**: In order to get the location of both origin and destination airports you have to join the airports data 2 times onto the flights data. Hence, you have to be careful with the names. (Which `lon` belongs to the origin and which to the destination...?)
